        <p>The report, which came from interviews with more than 2,000 working-age U.S. residents, shows 46.7% are sticking to a budget for groceries, making several shifts in what they buy. Most people say they are cutting back on premium brands (61.3%) and alcohol (48.9%), but more than one in five say they are buying fewer fresh fruits and vegetables. The only category that is seeing any general uptick in sales is value and private label brands, but the overall pullback in spending is keeping that increase small ‚Äî just 0.4%.</p>

        <p>Fresh vegetables are naturally grown plant parts, rich in essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber, offering a wide range of health benefits when consumed in their most natural state, providing a vibrant array of colors and textures while being low in calories and fat, making them a crucial part of a balanced diet; look for bright, crisp produce with no signs of damage to ensure freshness. </p>

        <p>I often talk about the freshness of fish during the sushi class. Then, one participant asks me, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean by fresh?‚Äù I become speechless. I always thought fresh means fresh. Then, when it is time for me to explain what I mean by fresh, I find myself not being able to explain what I just said. </p>
